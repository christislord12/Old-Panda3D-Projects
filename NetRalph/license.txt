The NetRalph computer code is currently maintained as a repository  on GitHub. 

There's probaby not enough there yet to warrant any reuse by others but if 
you want to use something from it, feel free. 

For now I have not put any of the code under any license 
so its in the purest sense of the word free.

Please note though that this is not the case for the included content 
from the Panda3D "Roaming Ralph" tutorial 
(everything under the models directory) and also probably for 
the code in client.py as this might still be considered a very 
remote derivative of the original Roaming Ralph code).
